    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">Initially, I would express the importance of web security amongst all those involved in the web development process. This includes developers writing secured code, engineers applying thorough testing and management/executives ensuring that shortcuts arenâ€™t taken. Next, I would educate them on the different forms of cyber attacks that could occur (e.g. cross-site scripting, SQL injecting and cross-site request forgery). This is a critical aspect as without knowing how attacks could occur, people will be unaware of how to prevent or counter them. From this, I would suggest that a security framework be put in place for adequate prevention of an attack and responsiveness if one were to occur. I would then recommend the use of a trusted continuous deployment/continuous integration platform (e.g. Github Action). This will prevent unknown code branches being developed and ensure that changes are checked and regulated before implementation. Thus, preventing the risks of security breaches. Lastly, it is important to put these security measures to test. This can be done in a variety of ways, including the regular use of vulnerability scanners, penetration testing or the hiring of external people to attempt to breach the website. This will provide a very clear indication as to where the web security issues lie so they can be addressed prior to the occurrence of a real attack. Overall, there are many recommendations that can be made, but this process is an ideal start that should continue to be developed on.</p>
